x Change the default java to the one installed in the bootstrap script (openjdk-7-jdk): Not needed now?

Register PyCharm with the license file
x Change the inotify limit for PyCharm: Not needed now?
Change PyCharm prefrences (which hopefully I can do in the future by just importing a saved prefs file)

Install node and npm with the install_node.sh stuff (while logged in as vagrant) (Maybe we'd prefer "local" to be in Development, but whatever)
Install gulp (npm install -g gulp) (and then probably lots of others...)

Add git repos (included in load_git_repos.sh but need password to access)

x Install Chrome (Beta): now added to bootstrap script
x Installed pip: now added to bootstrap script
x Installed boto: now added to bootstrap script
Set boto credentials (from boto creds file)

x sudo apt-get install rdesktop: Now added to bootstrap script

x sudo apt-get install dkms build-essential linux-headers-generic: Now added to bootstrap script

Upgraded all packages that were elligible (but not to 14.04).  Got some weirdness dealing with GRUB but didn't seem to matter.
Restarted
Installed (updated) VirtualBox guest additions (but was it necessary?)
