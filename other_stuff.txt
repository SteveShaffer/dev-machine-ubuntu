Upgraded all packages that were elligible (but not to 14.04).  Got some weirdness dealing with GRUB but didn't seem to matter.  (Could just use sudo apt-get upgrade and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade?)
Restarted (sudo reboot)
Installed (updated) VirtualBox guest additions (but was it necessary?)
Restarted
Un-mirrored displays
Set view to fullscreen
Moved display configuration around to make windows flow smoothly across display edges

Set clipboard to bidirectional (could do this in Vagrantfile instead?)

Register PyCharm with the license file
x Change the inotify limit for PyCharm: Not needed now?
Change PyCharm prefrences (which hopefully I can do in the future by just importing a saved prefs file)

Add git repos (included in load_git_repos.sh but need password to access)

Install node and npm with the install_node.sh stuff (while logged in as vagrant) (Maybe we'd prefer "local" to be in Development, but whatever)
Install gulp (npm install -g gulp) (and then probably lots of others...)

Set boto credentials (from boto creds file)

Disabled screen locking
Set time zone
