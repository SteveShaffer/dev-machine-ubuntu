Change the default java to the one installed in the bootstrap script (openjdk-7-jdk)

Register PyCharm with the license file
Change the inotify limit for PyCharm
Change PyCharm prefrences (which hopefully I can do in the future by just importing a saved prefs file)

Install node and npm with the install_node.sh stuff (while logged in as vagrant)
Install gulp (npm install -g gulp) (and then probably lots of others...)

Install Chrome (Dev): now added to bootstrap script
